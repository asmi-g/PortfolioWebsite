									<h2>Adaptive Signal Transmission & Real-time Analytics (ASTRA) - Stratospheric Experiment</h2>
									<p>This project uses the an Nvidia Jetson SoM, 2 HackRF SDRs, and the MCP9808 temperature sensor, to analyze and filter recieved signal data with temperature logging capabilities.</p>
									<p>This project was created as part of the CANSBX7 submission on behalf of the Waterloo Space Research Team.</p>
									<p>It uses SDR scripts from GNU Radio RX and TX workflows, bash systemd scripts for automation, and protocols like I2C to run. Its planned to be launched on a high-altitude stratospheric balloon to test the extent to which the system can filter the signal, as part of the CANSBX7 competition in collaboration with the CSA.</p>

									<h2>Controls Subsystem - Space Soldering Centrifuge Experiment</h2>
									<p>This project uses the L298N motor driver, a 24V gear motor, the MPU6050 accelerometer, an SD Module as well as an Arduino, to track and save acceleration and gyroscopic data while driving the motor.</p>
									<p>This project is a subsystem that was created as part of the CANRGX7 submission on behalf of the Waterloo Space Soldering Team.</p>
									<p>It uses protocols like I2C (accelerometer), SPI (SD module), and PWM (drives the motor) to run. Its planned use is to be mounted inside a centrifuge that will test soldering quality in microgravity, as part of the CANRGX7 competition in collaboration with the CSA (more details in the Experience section, under WSST).</p>
									<p>With our current working design, I also Implemented bidirectional USART communication with the STM32 for motor control, to interface with a GUI developed using tkinter and pyserial. This helps us to control the motor speed, and whether it's on or off using the GUI, to prevent having to rebuild and reflash the code and having to hard code a PWM value.</p>

									<h2>Electric Bike Motor Controller</h2>
									<p>This project is an electric bike motor controller, that was implemented using Nucleo STM32, Arduino C++, and SimpleFOC. The purpose was to drive a BLDC motor system using the DRV8301 motor driver.</p>
									<p>It incorporates various communication protocols like SPI, to detect and rectify over-current and over-thermal errors on the motor driver.</p>
									<p>It was created as part of the Electrium design team, for the Spring 2023 Electric bike project.</p>

									<h2>Weather Balloon Payload - UW Orbital</h2>
									<p>This project uses the ArduCAM OV5640, an SD Module as well as an Arduino, to take a picture and save it to the SD module.</p>
									<p>This project is a subsystem that was created as part of the Weather Balloon Project during my time at UW Orbital (a cube satellite design team).</p>
									<p>It uses protocols like I2C (ArduCAM), and SPI (SD module). Its planned use was to be mounted under the surface of the weather balloon, that was to be launched into the lower Earth atmosphere to take pictures while ascending of our home, the planet below (more details in the Experience section, under UW Orbital).</p>
